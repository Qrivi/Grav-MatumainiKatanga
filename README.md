## Local setup

To run this theme locally (eg. for development), check out this repository into an existing Grav installation's  `/user/themes` directory. Make sure you have a PHP server running and a working Grav instance so you can set _Matumaini Theme_ as the active theme.

[Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org) is used to transpile and bundle assets. See [`assets/package.json`](assets/package.json) for useful watch and build npm scripts. This means you need to install Nodejs and run `npm install` in order to work on styles and/or scripts.
